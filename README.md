# Care Home Demand Simulator

Code used to create the [Care Home Demand](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/care-home-demand/) tool.

This is built as a Quarto dashboard incorporating Shiny, and also uses the Python package [ASDM](https://github.com/wzh1895/ASDM) (Agile System Dynamics Modelling), developed by Wang Zhao, as the system dynamics engine driving the simulation.

The r package `reticulate` is used to translate between R and Python.
